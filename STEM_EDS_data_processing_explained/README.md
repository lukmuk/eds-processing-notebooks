# STEM-EDS Processing Notebooks

Notebooks with explanations for STEM-EDS spectrum images, i.e., TEM sample with low bremsstrahlung background.

The notebooks are work in progress. Please double check the analysis results!

## Notes

- A lot of useful information is provided in the [HyperSpy documentation](https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/index.html)
- Scikit-learn info on [MSA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#decompositions)

## Datasets

`EDS_dataset.bcf` - STEM-EDS spectrum images of a cross-section sample of a REBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin film grown on SrTiO$_3$. Acquired on an FEI Tecnai Osiris at 200 keV.
