# STEM-EDS Processing Notebooks

Notebooks with explanations for STEM-EDS spectrum images, i.e., TEM sample with low bremsstrahlung background.

The notebooks are work in progress. Please double check the analysis results!

## Datasets

`EDS_dataset.bcf` - STEM-EDS spectrum images of a cross-section sample of a REBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin film grown on SrTiO$_3$. Acquired on an FEI Tecnai Osiris at 200 keV.
